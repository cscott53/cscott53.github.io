                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <h3>Charles W. “Will” Scott</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan but was then adopted and have
                        lived in Charlotte, NC ever since then (since I was a few weeks old). I started with the boy scouts in 
                        6th grade and went to Manus Academy (a school for students on the Autism spectrum, now called Ignite
                        Achievement Academy since the owner retired (I think)) from grade 6-10 and went to Myers Park from grade
                        11-12 but in my senior year they took a couple classes out of that semester and replaced them with electives
                        (to make it less stressful) and moved the remaining 2 classes required for graduation into the next semester.
                        I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in September 2021 after turning 18 and one of my teachers (from a class I
                        took in my (first) senior year) told me about Year Up (in the final semester before graduation) since she knew
                        I was interested in computers. I started applying for it and had orientation with that group at CPCC but my dad
                        and I found out I needed accommodations like sitting in the front row in an in person class and stuff like that
                        but when the accommodations finally came it was too late and it was already the first day of Year Up classes
                        (3/14/22) so I just enrolled in CPCC like most students normally would and started taking general courses like
                        biology and psychology (since I was interested in those in high school and wanted to get a "feel" for what
                        classes at CPCC would be like) and then started wanting to pursue computer programming and wanted to become
                        either a software developer for Apple or a game developer (i never ended up taking game dev classes) or web
                        development/programming (I started getting interested in that in the next spring (2023) when I took WEB110)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I recently started working for a friend to help him with programming
                        for the first two sensors for a robotic helicopter (I still have to finish a ROS2 course I'm taking online
                        (not at CPCC)). He works for the Dept of Defence and takes one-man helicopters and takes out the insides and
                        puts computers in them to turn them into robotic helicopters so they end up being similar to drones but instead
                        of having a controller to control them they run off of a computer program to go from point a to point b and pick
                        something up then to point c to drop it off then back to point a and land for example.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I graduated from Myers Park HS mid-year (Feb 2022) and started taking classes at CPCC
                        in summer of that same year. I started getting interested in computer programming in the fall and wanted to become a software
                        developer for Apple but I'm mostly interested in just programming (mostly web programming and graphics)
                    </li>

                        <li><strong>I'd Also Like to Share:</strong>  I enjoy making up recreational projects for programming and some of the ones I've worked on are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Chess in python and pygame (pygame is a 2d graphics framework for python) (I haven't finished it yet and it has a couple bugs)</li>
                                <li>A rubix cube in Three.js (Three.js is a 3d rendering framework for HTML/JS similar to WebGL but a lot simpler)</li>
                                <li>Conway's Game of Life (I made it in python pygame and in HTML/CSS/JS and in SFML (a 2d graphics library for C++ similar to pygame))</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                </ul>
