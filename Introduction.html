            <li>Personal Background: I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout a couple years ago in September. I’m planning to major in computer programming and have recently met a friend who hired me to program a couple sensors for one of his robotic helicopters. My favorite hobbies are video games, watching movies and youtube, and experimenting with personal projects with programming</li>
            <li>Academic Background: I graduated from Myers Park high school this past February and was one of the few mid year graduates. This is my second year at CPCC.</li>
            <li>Background in this Subject:  I started learning HTML last fall (CTI110) and that’s what got me into programming. After that I wanted to start learning CSS so I started with WEB110 but in that class I also learned a little bit of Javascript so that’s what got me into this class</li>
