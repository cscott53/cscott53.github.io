                <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Charles W. Scott</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2022 WEB115-N801 Web markup and scripting course with my instructor, Professor Von Briesen.</p>
                <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
                <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
                <p>Signed: Charles W. Scott, 15 August 2023</p>
