                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout a couple years ago in September. I’m planning to major in computer programming and have recently met a friend who hired me to program a couple sensors for one of his robotic helicopters. My favorite hobbies are video games, watching movies and youtube, and experimenting with personal projects with programming</li>
                    <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I graduated from Myers Park high school this past February and was one of the few mid year graduates. This is my second year at CPCC.</li>
                    <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong>  I started learning HTML last fall (CTI110) and that’s what got me into programming. After that I wanted to start learning CSS so I started with WEB110 but in that class I also learned a little bit of Javascript so that’s what got me into this class</li>
                    <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>  MacOS Ventura (Intel Macbook Air 2020)</li>

                                    <li><strong>WEB110 - Web Development Fundamentals:</strong> When I first started taking CTI110 I realized I wanted to learn more about HTML and CSS</li>
